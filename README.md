# Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities - Data Visualization  - Lab Report #3

This repository contains sample datasets for the Washington University in St. Louis graduate seminar **Humanities by the Numbers: Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities**.

Each folder contains a csv that can be imported into [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) and used for **Lab Report #3**. Each folder also includes background information about the original source of the data and the methodologies used to compile it.

The sample datasets include: [refugee arrivals to the U.S. by country and religion (2005-2010)](/sample-datasets/us-refugee-arrivals/); [the subject of biographical films (or "biopics") by race and gender (1915-2014)](/sample-datasets/biopics/); and [the NYT Best Books of the Year by author age, author gender, and book publisher (1996-2017)](/sample-datasets/nyt-best-books/).
