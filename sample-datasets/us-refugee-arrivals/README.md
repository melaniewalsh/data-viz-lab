This folder contains data about refugee arrivals to the United States between 2005 and 2015, which was originally compiled from the Department of State's [Refugee Processing Center](https://www.wrapsnet.org/) by Jeremy Singer-Vine for his BuzzFeed article ["Where U.S. Refugees Come From — And Go — In Charts"](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jsvine/where-us-refugees-come-from-and-go-in-charts?utm_term=.cwJvM8R4kq#.vooNwy74jO). The original data and the code that Singer-Vine used to analyze the data (in Python) can be found in [this BuzzFeedNews GitHub repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2015-11-refugees-in-the-united-states).
