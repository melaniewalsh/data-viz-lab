This folder contains data about biographical films or "biopics" from 1915-2014, which was originally compiled by Hannah Fingerhut for the 538 article ["‘Straight Outta Compton’ Is The Rare Biopic Not About White Dudes"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/straight-outta-compton-is-the-rare-biopic-not-about-white-dudes/).

## Data & Methodology

This csv contains information about the director, title, release year, and earnings of the film; the name, occupation, race, and gender of the biographical subject featured; and the lead actor or actress who played the biographical subject. 

This data was compiled from an IMDb search "for feature films categorized within the 'biography' genre and released in the United States, the U.K. or Canada since 1900." Fingerhut additionally explains:

>[The films in the sample had to have been rated by at least 500 IMDb users, to ensure they were well known and to keep my sample size manageable. Twenty films were excluded from the initial sample because the name of the actual subject was unknown, or because they had five or more subjects....To determine the subjects’ racial background, I researched each of them for information on their ancestry or how they identify themselves. I couldn’t get this information for roughly a quarter of subjects.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/straight-outta-compton-is-the-rare-biopic-not-about-white-dudes/).
